My zsh prompt starts with a cute cloud. 
I have nothing agains clouds. I like clouds...
But this one was a little bit useless.
So I said to myself: Myself, Why don't you put the current weather condition in your prompt?
And that's how this happened.

The scripts connects to google an asks for the weather in a particular zipcode.
You can replace the zipcode with the name of a city and it should also work.

Personaly I have cron job running every 1/2 h storing the weather into my $WEATHER env var...
But you could do something useful in many other ways.
